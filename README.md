😎 The ultimate spooky roleplay map – inspired by the FNaF universe!

Five Nights at Pixels: The Facility is a fully handcrafted Minecraft map delivering a dark and immersive horror RP experience. Created by a small team, it features atmospheric environments, flexible gameplay, and multiplayer support for thrilling horror RP sessions with friends.

⚠️ Important:
Five Nights at Pixels: The Facility is an original series created by us and is not affiliated with the official Fazbear Facility game or its lore. This modpack series is designed for you to create and explore your own unique stories and lore.

❓Shader
Shader is disabled when you start the game for the first time because we don't know how powerful your PC is. You can decide for yourself which shader settings you want to use. “Recommended” is the setting for which the map is designed, but if you have a less powerful PC, use the other settings.
